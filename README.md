AGMH means **ANTI GITHUB & MICROSOFT HYSTERIA**.

AGMH is a local backup and repository mirroring CLI built to help researchers,
maintainers, and software teams pull their work out of GitHub quickly and push
it to other forges without losing years of history, branches, tags, or research.

It discovers repositories from GitHub profiles or organizations, clones them
locally as mirrors, adds a small provenance marker file, creates matching
repositories on destination platforms, and pushes the backup to GitLab,
Codeberg/Forgejo, SourceHut, Bitbucket, or compatible Git remotes.

The primary CLI command is:

```bash
agmh
```

The older `aghm` alias still works for compatibility.

## Project Statement

This tool exists because people need a fast, practical way to remove their work
from a platform before a platform removes them.

AGMH was built in the context of a ban-wave against security researchers and the
public conflict around MSRC, the Microsoft Security Response Center, and the
researchers behind:

- https://x.com/ChaoticEclipse0
- https://x.com/xploitrsturtle2

The position of this project is explicit: when a centralized development
platform adopts policies that can be used to repress security researchers
because triagers, vendors, or corporate response teams had their egos bruised,
researchers need escape tools. If the people responsible for keeping software
secure had done their job, the ecosystem would not be in this situation.

This is not a personal fight with GitHub. It is a practical statement that
people must have the right and the ability to remove their own work from GitHub
and move it elsewhere before they lose years of research, tooling, issue
history, public contributions, branches, tags, and project continuity.

AGMH was produced by **Haltman.IO** as a peaceful protest and as a practical
tool. It was not produced by `@extencil`, but by the same group he is part of,
and it is released freely so others can protect their own work.

This tool has already been used to back up repositories from `@extencil` and
`@haltman-io` to GitLab, Codeberg, and SourceHut successfully.

This may be the last Haltman.IO project released on this shameful platform,
which in the view of this project has adopted a policy of repression against
security researchers because two of them hurt the ego of MSRC triagers.

## Public Mirrors And Accounts

AGMH was used to move the work of `@extencil` and `@haltman-io` away from
GitHub and into independent mirrors.

Extencil mirrors:

- GitLab: https://gitlab.com/extencil
- Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/extencil
- SourceHut: https://git.sr.ht/~extencil

Haltman.IO mirrors:

- GitLab: https://gitlab.com/haltman-io
- Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/haltman

Extencil also uses X, where he exposed the case around his ban:

- X profile: https://x.com/extencil
- Ban case statement: https://x.com/extencil/status/2065150696937115988

## What It Does

AGMH can:

- Read GitHub profile or organization URLs from a text file.
- Discover accessible public and private GitHub repositories.
- Use one or more GitHub tokens to increase API limits and access private repos.
- Rotate tokens when rate limits or authorization failures happen.
- Clone each repository locally using `git clone --mirror`.
- Run in local-only mode to download/update mirrors without pushing anywhere.
- Run in remote-only mode to push existing local mirrors to configured destinations later.
- Keep a local backup under `backups/` by default.
- Add `anti-gh-ms-hysteria.txt` to the default branch before mirroring.
- Create destination repositories through platform APIs.
- Preserve repository name and public/private visibility where supported.
- Push mirrors to GitLab, Codeberg/Forgejo, SourceHut, Bitbucket, and similar Git destinations.
- Use resumable state in `.aghm/state.json`.
- Write detailed logs to `.aghm/logs/`.
- Run dry-run simulations.
- Use proxies.
- Disable TLS verification when needed for intercepting proxies.
- Use SSH keys for destinations such as SourceHut.
- Keep going when one repository fails instead of aborting the whole run.

## Supported Platforms

AGMH currently treats GitHub as the source platform.

Destination support:

| Platform | API create | HTTPS push | SSH push | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitLab | Yes | Yes | Possible with custom URL | Hidden repo names such as `.github` are mapped to valid GitLab paths such as `dot-github`. |
| Codeberg | Yes | Yes | Possible with custom URL | Uses Forgejo API. GitHub `refs/pull/*` refs are excluded in portable mirror mode because Codeberg rejects hidden refs. |
| Forgejo/Gitea | Yes | Yes | Possible with custom URL | Same adapter family as Codeberg. |
| SourceHut | Yes | Optional | Yes | API token creates repositories, SSH is recommended for Git pushes. |
| Bitbucket | Yes | Yes | Possible with custom URL | Requires Bitbucket-compatible credentials. |

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- Git available in `PATH`.
- Network access to GitHub and destination forges.
- Destination accounts and tokens with enough permission to create repositories and push Git refs.
- Optional: `git-lfs` if you enable `lfs = true`.
- Optional: `ssh-agent` and SSH keys for SourceHut or SSH-based destinations.

Ubuntu system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git ca-certificates openssh-client
```

Optional packages:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git-lfs curl
```

Notes:

- `git-lfs` is only required when AGMH is configured with `lfs = true`.
- `curl` is used only for the troubleshooting and proxy test commands shown in this README.
- If your Ubuntu release provides Python older than 3.11, install Python 3.11 or newer before creating the virtual environment.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haltman-io/agmh.git
cd agmh
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install AGMH in editable mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e ".[tui]"
```

Check the CLI:

```bash
agmh --help
agmh run --help
```

Compatibility aliases:

```bash
aghm --help
anti-gh-ms-hysteria --help
python -m anti_gh_ms_hysteria --help
```

If you do not install the package, you can run it with `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m anti_gh_ms_hysteria run --help
```

## Quick Start

Create a starter config:

```bash
cp config.example.toml agmh.config.toml
```

Create `targets.txt` from the public-safe example:

```bash
cp targets.example.txt targets.txt
$EDITOR targets.txt
```

If you prefer to keep destinations in a separate file instead of inline TOML,
start from the destination example:

```bash
cp destinations.example.txt destinations.txt
$EDITOR destinations.txt
```

Export tokens:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_token_here"
export GITLAB_TOKEN="gitlab_token_here"
export CODEBERG_TOKEN="codeberg_token_here"
export SOURCEHUT_TOKEN="sourcehut_token_here"
```

Run a dry-run first:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --dry-run --verbose
```

Run the real backup:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --verbose
```

Check state:

```bash
agmh state --config agmh.config.toml
```

## Workflow Modes

Default full workflow:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --verbose
```

This discovers GitHub repositories, clones or updates local mirrors, adds the
marker commit, creates destination repositories, and pushes mirrors.

Local mirror only:

```bash
agmh local-mirror --config agmh.config.toml --verbose
```

Equivalent:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --mode local --verbose
```

This discovers GitHub repositories and only clones or updates local bare mirrors
under `backup.local_dir`. It does not create marker commits and does not contact
destination forges, even if destinations are present in the config.

Remote mirror from existing local mirrors:

```bash
agmh remote-mirror --config agmh.config.toml --verbose
```

Equivalent:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --mode remote --verbose
```

This does not discover or clone from GitHub. It reads mirrors recorded in
`.aghm/state.json`, falls back to scanning `backup.local_dir`, adds the marker
commit if needed, creates destination repositories, and pushes the local mirrors.
When AGMH has to scan local mirrors without state metadata, repository privacy is
unknown, so it treats those repositories as private by default.

You can also set the mode in TOML:

```toml
mode = "full"   # full, local, or remote
```

## Input Files

AGMH reads source profiles from a plain text file. One GitHub profile or
organization URL per line:

```txt
https://github.com/extencil/
https://github.com/haltman-io/
```

Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored.

You can also pass source profiles directly:

```bash
agmh run --source https://github.com/extencil/ --source https://github.com/haltman-io/
```

Destinations can be configured in TOML or in a plain text file:

```txt
https://gitlab.com/haltman-io
https://codeberg.org/haltman
https://git.sr.ht/~extencil
```

## Tokens

Use environment variables. Do not hardcode tokens into config files committed to
Git.

GitHub:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
```

GitLab:

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="..."
```

Codeberg:

```bash
export CODEBERG_TOKEN="..."
```

SourceHut:

```bash
export SOURCEHUT_TOKEN="..."
```

You can pass extra tokens from the CLI:

```bash
agmh run \
  --source https://github.com/haltman-io/ \
  --github-token env:GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --destination https://gitlab.com/haltman-io \
  --destination-token gitlab:env:GITLAB_TOKEN
```

Multiple tokens are allowed. AGMH rotates tokens when a token is rejected, rate
limited, or temporarily unusable.

In TOML arrays, every token entry must be separated by a comma:

```toml
[github]
tokens = [
  { env = "GITHUB_TOKEN", name = "github-primary" },
  { env = "GITHUB_TOKEN_2", name = "github-secondary" },
]
```

You can also use a named token table:

```toml
[github.tokens]
github-primary = { env = "GITHUB_TOKEN" }
github-secondary = "env:GITHUB_TOKEN_2"
```

## Marker File

Before pushing to destinations, AGMH writes a marker file into the default
branch of the local mirror:

```txt
anti-gh-ms-hysteria.txt
```

The marker contains:

```txt
source_url=https://github.com/owner/repo
downloaded_at=2026-06-12T00:00:00Z
marker_created_at=2026-06-12T00:00:01Z
```

This is intentional. It makes it clear where the backup came from and when the
backup process created the provenance marker.

## Push Modes

`mirror`:

Uses `git push --mirror` when the destination accepts every ref.

`portable-mirror`:

Pushes branches and tags while excluding platform-specific refs such as
GitHub pull request refs under `refs/pull/*`. This is useful for Codeberg and
Forgejo, which can reject hidden refs.

`all`:

Runs `git push --all` and then `git push --tags`.

`default`:

Pushes only the default branch.

Recommended defaults:

| Destination | Recommended push mode |
| --- | --- |
| GitLab | `mirror` |
| Codeberg/Forgejo | `mirror`, automatically translated to `portable-mirror` |
| SourceHut | `mirror` over SSH, or `portable-mirror` if hidden refs cause rejection |
| Bitbucket | `portable-mirror` |

## Proxy Usage

Use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --verbose
```

Use a remote proxy:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --proxy http://83.143.242.45:31343 --verbose
```

If the proxy intercepts TLS and you know what you are doing:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --insecure --verbose
```

`--insecure` is equivalent to `-k`:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 -k
```

This disables certificate verification for API calls and sets
`GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true` for Git HTTPS operations.

### Segfault.net Proxy Route

When GitHub API access is being rate-limited, blocked, or degraded from your
local network, you can route AGMH through a temporary HTTP proxy exposed from a
Segfault.net disposable root server.

Segfault.net is a project from The Hacker's Choice (THC). THC is an international hacker and IT security research group founded in 1995.
Segfault.net provides disposable root servers: each SSH login creates a root
server inside a virtual machine, with a public reverse TCP/UDP port option and
outbound traffic routed through upstream VPN networks. This makes it useful as a
temporary network exit path when the GitHub API is unusable from your current
IP address.

Open a Segfault.net shell:

```bash
ssh root@segfault.net
```

The public demo password is:

```text
segfault
```

Inside the Segfault.net server, request a public reverse port:

```bash
curl sf/port
```

Example output:

```text
Tip: Type cat /config/self/reverse_* for details.
Tip: Type rshell to start listening.
Tip: Type curl sf/port to assign a new port.
Your reverse Port is 83.143.242.45 31343 [83.143.242.45:31343]
```

Start an HTTP proxy listener on that assigned port:

```bash
gost -L http://:31343
```

Keep this SSH session open. The proxy exists only while the Segfault.net
environment and the `gost` process are alive. If the shell is closed or a new
Segfault.net server is created, request a new port and update the AGMH command.

On your workstation, run AGMH through the public proxy:

```bash
agmh run \
  --config agmh.config.toml \
  --verbose \
  --proxy http://83.143.242.45:31343 \
  --insecure
```

Use `--insecure` or `-k` only when TLS verification fails because of the proxy
path or interception layer. If normal certificate validation works through the
proxy, remove `--insecure`.

Before running a full migration, test the proxy path directly:

```bash
curl -I \
  --proxy http://83.143.242.45:31343 \
  https://api.github.com/users/extencil
```

Then run a short AGMH dry run with retries disabled:

```bash
agmh run \
  --config agmh.config.toml \
  --dry-run \
  --verbose \
  --proxy http://83.143.242.45:31343 \
  --insecure \
  --request-timeout 5 \
  --max-retries 0
```

This proxy path affects AGMH API calls and Git HTTPS operations. It does not
automatically proxy SSH pushes such as `git@git.sr.ht:~user/repo`, because SSH
does not use the HTTP proxy settings.

## SSH Usage

SourceHut is best used with SSH for Git pushes.

SourceHut destination:

```toml
[[destinations]]
url = "https://git.sr.ht/~extencil"
platform = "sourcehut"
tokens = [{ env = "SOURCEHUT_TOKEN", name = "sourcehut-primary" }]
visibility = "mirror"
push_mode = "mirror"
push_url_template = "git@git.sr.ht:~{owner}/{repo}"
```

If your SSH key is not a default key, configure it:

```toml
[git]
ssh_identity_file = "/home/user/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519"
ssh_identities_only = true
ssh_strict_host_key_checking = "accept-new"
```

Or pass it at runtime:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519 \
  --ssh-strict-host-key-checking accept-new
```

If the key has a passphrase, use `ssh-agent`:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519
```

Test before running AGMH:

```bash
ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes git@git.sr.ht
```

Do not use a private key directly from a Windows-mounted path such as
`/mnt/c/Users/...` if OpenSSH reports permissive permissions. Copy it into the
Linux filesystem and lock permissions:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
cp /mnt/c/Users/andre/.ssh/private_id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519
```

## Dry Run

Dry-run still calls platform APIs for discovery. It does not create repos,
clone, add marker commits, or push.

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --dry-run --verbose
```

Fail fast while debugging network/proxy issues:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml \
  --dry-run \
  --verbose \
  --request-timeout 5 \
  --max-retries 0
```

## Resume and State

AGMH stores resumable state here:

```txt
.aghm/state.json
```

Logs are stored here:

```txt
.aghm/logs/
```

Show a state summary:

```bash
agmh state --config agmh.config.toml
```

Force completed steps to rerun:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --force
```

Ignore existing state:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --no-resume
```

## Operational Examples

Discover only:

```bash
agmh discover --sources targets.txt
```

Write discovery output to JSON:

```bash
agmh discover --sources targets.txt --output discovered-repos.json
```

Back up one GitHub org to GitLab:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
export GITLAB_TOKEN="..."

agmh run \
  --source https://github.com/haltman-io/ \
  --destination https://gitlab.com/haltman-io \
  --destination-token gitlab:env:GITLAB_TOKEN \
  --github-token env:GITHUB_TOKEN \
  --verbose
```

Use Codeberg:

```bash
export CODEBERG_TOKEN="..."

agmh run \
  --source https://github.com/haltman-io/ \
  --destination https://codeberg.org/haltman \
  --destination-token forgejo:env:CODEBERG_TOKEN \
  --verbose
```

Use SourceHut over SSH:

```bash
export SOURCEHUT_TOKEN="..."

agmh run \
  --source https://github.com/haltman-io/ \
  --destination https://git.sr.ht/~extencil \
  --destination-token sourcehut:env:SOURCEHUT_TOKEN \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519 \
  --ssh-strict-host-key-checking accept-new \
  --verbose
```

Use a proxy and ignore TLS validation:

```bash
agmh run \
  --config agmh.config.toml \
  --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --insecure \
  --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### `No module named anti_gh_ms_hysteria`

You are running from a source checkout without installing the package.

Fix:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[tui]"
```

Or run with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m anti_gh_ms_hysteria run --help
```

### It hangs on `Discovering GitHub repositories`

The first GitHub API request is waiting on network, DNS, proxy, or TLS.

Run:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --dry-run -v --request-timeout 5 --max-retries 0
```

Check GitHub directly:

```bash
curl -I --max-time 10 https://api.github.com/users/extencil
```

### Proxy returns HTTP 500

Use verbose mode. AGMH prints full HTTP response details for failed HTTP
responses:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --insecure --verbose --max-retries 0
```

If the response body is from the proxy, fix the proxy. If it is from the
destination, inspect the API response.

### GitLab rejects `.github`

GitLab does not allow project paths starting with a dot. AGMH maps `.github` to
`dot-github` for GitLab destinations.

If old state points to the wrong path, AGMH rechecks create when destination
path mapping changes.

### Codeberg rejects `refs/pull/*`

Codeberg/Forgejo can reject hidden GitHub pull request refs:

```txt
deny updating a hidden ref
```

AGMH maps Forgejo/Codeberg `mirror` mode to `portable-mirror`, which pushes
branches and tags without GitHub `refs/pull/*`.

### `gnutls_handshake() failed`

This is usually a transient network, proxy, or TLS interruption during Git
push. AGMH retries this class of Git network failure.

You can also reduce concurrency outside AGMH and rerun. Failed state entries are
not marked `done`, so reruns continue from the failed push.

### SourceHut says `Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)`

Your Git subprocess did not use the correct SSH key, or the key was rejected.

Test as the same user, without `sudo`:

```bash
ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes git@git.sr.ht
```

Then run:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --ssh-key ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519
```

### OpenSSH says `UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE`

Private key permissions are too open. Fix:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/sourcehut_ed25519
```

If the key is under `/mnt/c`, copy it to the Linux filesystem first.

### `HTTP 401`

The token is invalid, expired, missing required scopes, or belongs to the wrong
account.

Check the environment:

```bash
printenv GITHUB_TOKEN
printenv GITLAB_TOKEN
printenv CODEBERG_TOKEN
printenv SOURCEHUT_TOKEN
```

Do not paste tokens into logs or issues.

### `HTTP 403` or `HTTP 429`

You hit rate limits or permission limits. AGMH rotates available tokens and, if
configured, waits for the reset window.

Use more tokens:

```toml
[github]
tokens = [
  { env = "GITHUB_TOKEN", name = "github-primary" },
  { env = "GITHUB_TOKEN_2", name = "github-secondary" },
]
```

### Repository already exists

By default, `allow_existing = true` lets AGMH continue and push into an existing
destination repository.

### Existing state skips something you want to retry

Use:

```bash
agmh run --config agmh.config.toml --force
```

or edit `.aghm/state.json` carefully.

## Security Notes

- Prefer environment variables for secrets.
- Do not commit `.aghm/`, `backups/`, `aghm.config.toml`, `targets.txt`, `destinations.txt`, or private config files.
- Logs scrub configured token secrets.
- If a token was ever printed before scrubbing existed, rotate it.
- `--insecure` is useful for debugging or intercepting proxies, but it disables TLS verification.
- SSH private keys must be readable only by your user.
